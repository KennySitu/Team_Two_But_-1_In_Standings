# Data Scraping
For the Mental Health Scrapping Data, all the content is stored in the Scraping_Data folder in Github. 
The Original PDFs contain all the PDFs downloaded from the source website. 
The HTML_Files contain all the converted HTML files from the Original PDFs. 
The CSV_Files folder contains all the csv files that contain the total mental health issues in a region 
while the Percentage_CSV_Files folder contains all the csv files that contain the percentage of the population with mental health issues. 
Lastly, the Jupyter notebook contains the code and my documentation that scraped and cleaned my data. 
All the other folders are not relevant to the project.

# Visualization
**Pairplot**<br>
**Heat map**<br>
According to the method of exploratory data analysis, we do the pairplot to show the relevance between each item at the very beginning.

Then we do the heat map.
